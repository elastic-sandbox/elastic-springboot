# Maven Spring Boot project to configure and run Elasticsearch with Java project
# via REST application. 

# Installing Elasticsearch
Download, install and test installation according to guidelines for your OS.

# Addresses
Once started, Elasticsearch will listen on port 9200 (http://localhost:9200/).
Port 9300 (also exposed) is for Elasticsearch Cluster Node.
Application runs at 8102.

# Application name
BootElastic

# How to run and use
Build the jar and run the application.
Using Postman / Insomnia / whatever you prefer post, search for and view and delete documents (users). 


#Final remarks
As the application is fairly simple all classes are placed in the same folder. When working on 
a real-life project I would of course split them between folders.
